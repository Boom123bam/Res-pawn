    <h2>The Science of Spaced Repetition</h2>
    <p>
      At the core of ReChess is the concept of spaced repetitionâ€”a
      scientifically proven technique for optimizing memory retention.
      We've tailored this technique specifically for chess enthusiasts
      like you. By systematically revisiting and reinforcing chess
      patterns, you'll sharpen your tactical skills and gain a deeper
      understanding of the game.
    </p>

    <h2>How ReChess Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Choose Your Challenge: Start by selecting puzzles from a
        diverse range of playlists, each offering different
        difficulties and themes. Whether you're a novice or a seasoned
        player, there's a puzzle set that suits your skill level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Solve Puzzles: Dive into the world of chess puzzles and put
        your skills to the test. Work your way through intriguing
        challenges and tactical conundrums.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rate Your Experience: After each puzzle, provide feedback on
        its difficulty level. This helps us fine-tune your training
        program to match your preferences and progress.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spaced Repetition: ReChess employs a smart algorithm to
        determine when to reintroduce puzzles you've solved. You'll
        revisit them at just the right time to reinforce your learning
        and enhance your pattern recognition skills.
      </li>
    </ul>
