    <!-- <h2>The Science of Spaced Repetition</h2>
    <p>
      At the core of ReChess is the concept of spaced repetitionâ€”a
      scientifically proven technique for optimizing memory retention.
      We've tailored this technique specifically for chess enthusiasts
      like you. By systematically revisiting and reinforcing chess
      patterns, you'll sharpen your tactical skills and gain a deeper
      understanding of the game.

        Repeating and mastering a select few puzzles is more
        beneficial than skimming through countless variations.
